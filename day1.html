                We present a new perspective on online learning that we refer to as gradient equilibrium: a sequence of iterates achieves gradient equilibrium if the average of gradients of losses along the sequence converges to zero. In general, this condition is not implied by, nor implies, sublinear regret. It turns out that gradient equilibrium is achievable by standard online learning methods such as gradient descent and mirror descent with constant step sizes (rather than decaying step sizes, as is usually required for no regret). Further, as we show through examples, gradient equilibrium translates into an interpretable and meaningful property in online prediction problems spanning regression, classification, quantile estimation, and others. Notably, we show that the gradient equilibrium framework can be used to develop a debiasing scheme for black-box predictions under arbitrary distribution shift, based on simple post hoc online descent updates. We also show that post hoc gradient updates can be used to calibrate predicted quantiles under distribution shift, and that the framework leads to unbiased Elo scores for pairwise preference prediction.

                We consider a dynamic mechanism design problem where an auctioneer sells an indivisible good to groups of buyers in every round, for a total of T rounds. The auctioneer aims to maximize their discounted overall revenue while adhering to a fairness constraint that guarantees a minimum average allocation for each group. We begin by studying the static case (T=1) and establish that the optimal mechanism involves two types of subsidization: one that increases the overall probability of allocation to all buyers, and another that favors the groups which otherwise have a lower probability of winning the item. We then extend our results to the dynamic case by characterizing a set of recursive functions that determine the optimal allocation and payments in each round. Notably, our results establish that in the dynamic case, the seller, on the one hand, commits to a participation bonus to incentivize truth-telling, and on the other hand, charges an entry fee for every round. Moreover, the optimal allocation once more involves subsidization, which its extent depends on the difference in future utilities for both the seller and buyers when allocating the item to one group versus the others. Finally, we present an approximation scheme to solve the recursive equations and determine an approximately optimal and fair allocation efficiently. Based on joint work with Annie Ulichney and Michael I. Jordan.

                Accurately determining the outcome of an election is a complex task with many potential sources of error, ranging from software glitches in voting machines to procedural lapses to outright fraud. Risk-limiting audits (RLA) are statistically principled "incremental" hand counts that provide statistical assurance that reported outcomes accurately reflect the validly cast votes. We present a suite of tools for conducting RLAs using confidence sequences -- sequences of confidence sets which uniformly capture an electoral parameter of interest from the start of an audit to the point of an exhaustive recount with high probability. Adopting the SHANGRLA framework, we design nonnegative martingales which yield computationally and statistically efficient confidence sequences and RLAs for a wide variety of election types.

            ODEs/SDEs have recently gained significant attention in machine learning and causal inference. However, the theoretical aspects, for example, identifiability and asymptotic properties of statistical estimation are still obscure. In this presentation, I will present our recent results on identifiability of linear ODE/SDEs from observational data. These identifiability conditions are crucial in causal inference using linear ODE/SDEs as they enable the identification of the post-intervention distributions from its observational distribution.
